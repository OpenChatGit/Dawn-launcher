Linux uses the same official Steam mark and Inter font files as Windows. SVGs go through LunaSVG instead of the old software fallback.

WSL can build and open the Linux UI on the desktop with \`dev-wsl.ps1\` or \`build-wsl.sh --run\`.

Latest automatic build from \`main\`. This prerelease is replaced every time new code is pushed.

Use a \`v*\` tag when you want a fixed official version that stays published.
